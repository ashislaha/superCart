# Smart Order:

Let's focus how to help the customber with better "Basket Building" strategy. 

## Problem statement:

In Groceries, most of time the customber order 61% same product basket-wise (per weekly). The user needs more frictionless 
application where the application understands the customber end to end.

<b>
(1). Make my weekly shopping more efficient and help me discover new items I might like.
  
(2). Our customers heavily rely on search for multiple use cases. reduce the pain-point.

(3). We do not help our customers to make puchase decision. 

(4). 61% of loyal customber basket has exact same items to purchased in past orders. Out of remaining 39%, 25% have similar item being purchased in the past. 

</b>

## Solution:

<b>
(1). Using voice based chatBot the app is capturing the shopping list from the user to avoid multiple search.
  
(2). prepare the cart with generic inputs like “milk” and mapping it with right products based the user order history.

(3). Building true omnichannel experience by communicating in-club price drop, promotions in-app notification.

(4). Suggesting missing items to the user based on his/her past order

(5) allowing the user to choose substitute products (similar products) and recommendation (bought together) for each product

(6). Remind the user to restock their items based on their purchase interval through push notification (Restock capabilities).
